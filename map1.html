                <p>Ascent is known for its wide open mid area, which is crucial for controlling the flow of the game. Teams that dominate mid can easily pivot between A and B sites, putting a lot of pressure on defenders. The map is very balanced, offering fair chances for attackers and defenders. Ascent is often considered the "classic Valorant map" because of its simple yet deep tactical possibilities.</p>

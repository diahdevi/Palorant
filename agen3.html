            <h1>ISO</h1>
            <p>Iso, a Duelist from China, is a former assassin who now fights on 
                a global battlefield. Known for his ability to isolate enemies 
                in deadly one-on-one duels, Iso challenges anyone bold enough to face him. 
                After losing control of his powers and endangering those he cared about, 
                he now seeks redemption. Iso joined VALORANT to master his abilities and 
                confront the darkness within himself.</p>
